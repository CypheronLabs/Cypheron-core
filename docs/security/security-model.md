# Security Model

This document outlines the comprehensive security model implemented by Cypheron-Core, covering both the theoretical foundations of post-quantum cryptography and the practical security measures protecting the API.

## Cryptographic Security Model

### Post-Quantum Security Assumptions

Cypheron-Core's cryptographic security is based on mathematical problems that are believed to be hard for both classical and quantum computers:

#### Lattice-Based Security (Kyber, Dilithium)

**Mathematical Foundation**: Learning With Errors (LWE) and Module Learning With Errors (MLWE) problems.

**Security Assumption**: Given a matrix A and vector b = As + e (where s is secret and e is small error), it is computationally infeasible to recover s.

**Quantum Resistance**: No known quantum algorithms provide exponential speedup for lattice problems. Grover's algorithm provides only quadratic speedup.

**Concrete Security**:
- **Kyber-512**: ~103 bits classical security, ~85 bits quantum security
- **Kyber-768**: ~165 bits classical security, ~137 bits quantum security  
- **Kyber-1024**: ~230 bits classical security, ~191 bits quantum security
- **Dilithium-2**: ~103 bits classical security, ~85 bits quantum security
- **Dilithium-3**: ~165 bits classical security, ~137 bits quantum security
- **Dilithium-5**: ~230 bits classical security, ~191 bits quantum security

#### Hash-Based Security (SPHINCS+)

**Mathematical Foundation**: Collision resistance and preimage resistance of cryptographic hash functions.

**Security Assumption**: The underlying hash function (SHA-256, SHAKE-256) is secure against both classical and quantum attacks.

**Quantum Resistance**: Hash functions can be made quantum-resistant by doubling output lengths. SPHINCS+ uses quantum-secure parameter sets.

**Concrete Security**:
- **SPHINCS+-128**: 128 bits quantum security
- **SPHINCS+-192**: 192 bits quantum security
- **SPHINCS+-256**: 256 bits quantum security

#### Structured Lattice Security (Falcon)

**Mathematical Foundation**: Short Integer Solution (SIS) and Learning With Errors over NTRU lattices.

**Security Assumption**: Finding short vectors in NTRU lattices is computationally hard.

**Quantum Resistance**: Similar to other lattice problems, no exponential quantum speedup known.

**Concrete Security**:
- **Falcon-512**: ~103 bits classical security, ~85 bits quantum security
- **Falcon-1024**: ~230 bits classical security, ~191 bits quantum security

### Cryptographic Properties

#### Correctness
All algorithms implement perfect correctness:
- **KEM**: Decapsulation always recovers the correct shared secret
- **Signatures**: Valid signatures always verify correctly
- **No False Positives**: Invalid signatures never verify as valid

#### Unforgeability (Signatures)
Under the assumption that the underlying mathematical problems are hard:
- **Existential Unforgeability**: Computationally infeasible to forge signatures without private key
- **Strong Unforgeability**: Even with access to signatures on chosen messages, cannot forge new signatures
- **Non-Repudiation**: Signers cannot deny having signed a message

#### Semantic Security (KEM)
Under the assumption that the underlying mathematical problems are hard:
- **IND-CCA2 Security**: Indistinguishable under adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack
- **Key Indistinguishability**: Shared secrets are indistinguishable from random
- **Forward Secrecy**: Compromise of long-term keys doesn't affect past sessions (with ephemeral keys)

## API Security Architecture

### Authentication & Authorization

#### API Key Security Model

**Key Generation**:
- Cryptographically secure random generation (256-bit entropy)
- SHA-256 hashing for storage (keys never stored in plaintext)
- Unique key prefixes for easy identification (`pq_live_`, `pq_test_`)

**Permission Model**:
```
API Key → Permissions → Resources → Operations
```

**Permission Inheritance**:
- `*`: All operations on all resources
- `resource:*`: All operations on specific resource
- `resource:operation`: Specific operation only

**Authorization Flow**:
1. Extract API key from request headers
2. Hash key and lookup in secure storage
3. Validate key status (active, not expired)
4. Check permissions for requested resource
5. Update usage statistics
6. Allow or deny request

#### Authentication Security Properties

- **Confidentiality**: API keys use sufficient entropy to prevent brute force
- **Integrity**: SHA-256 hashing prevents key modification
- **Availability**: Rate limiting prevents denial of service
- **Non-Repudiation**: All operations are logged with key identification

### Transport Security

#### TLS Configuration

**Minimum TLS Version**: TLS 1.3
**Cipher Suites**: Only quantum-resistant suites when available
**Certificate Validation**: Full chain validation with OCSP stapling
**HSTS**: Enabled with long-term caching

**TLS 1.3 Benefits**:
- Forward secrecy by default
- Reduced handshake latency
- Protection against downgrade attacks
- Quantum-resistant key exchange (when PQ-TLS becomes available)

#### HTTP Security Headers

```http
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()
```

### Input Validation & Sanitization

#### Request Validation

**Parameter Validation**:
- Algorithm names validated against whitelist
- Base64 encoding validation for all cryptographic data
- Content-Length limits to prevent oversized requests
- JSON schema validation for request structure

**Path Validation**:

- Algorithm parameters validated against supported list
- Suspicious pattern detection (SQL injection, XSS, command injection)

**Content Validation**:
- Cryptographic parameter length validation
- Public/private key format validation
- Message size limits (configurable per algorithm)

#### Sanitization Process

1. **Input Parsing**: Strict JSON parsing with size limits
2. **Type Checking**: Ensure all parameters have correct types
3. **Range Validation**: Check all numeric values within acceptable ranges
4. **Format Validation**: Validate base64 encoding and key formats
5. **Cryptographic Validation**: Verify keys/signatures have correct structure

### Rate Limiting & DoS Protection

#### Rate Limiting Algorithm

**Token Bucket Implementation**:
- Configurable tokens per minute per API key
- Burst allowance for legitimate traffic spikes
- Exponential backoff recommendations
- Rate limit headers in all responses

**Rate Limiting Tiers**:
- **Free Tier**: 60 requests/minute
- **Standard Tier**: 1,000 requests/minute
- **Enterprise Tier**: 10,000 requests/minute
- **Custom Tiers**: Configurable limits

#### DoS Protection Measures

**Request Limits**:

- Connection timeout: 30 seconds
- Request timeout: 60 seconds
- Maximum concurrent connections per IP: 100

**Anomaly Detection**:

### Data Protection

1. **Generation**: Cryptographically secure random generation
2. **Storage**: HSM or secure enclave storage for production
3. **Usage**: Constant-time operations, secure memory handling
4. **Rotation**: Regular rotation of internal keys
5. **Destruction**: Secure deletion with memory overwriting

**Internal Key Protection**:
- API signing keys stored in Hardware Security Modules (HSM)
- Database encryption with separate key management

### Logging & Monitoring

#### Security Event Logging

**Logged Events**:
- All API authentication attempts (success/failure)
- Permission denials and authorization failures
- Rate limit violations and suspicious patterns
- Administrative actions (key creation, deletion)
- System errors and cryptographic operation failures

**Log Format**:
```json

  "timestamp": "2024-01-20T14:22:33Z",
  "event_type": "authentication_failed",
  "source_ip": "192.168.1.100",
