# Development Roadmap

This section provides an overview of Cypheron Core's development timeline and current priorities.

For complete details, see the full [Development Roadmap](../../ROADMAP.md).

## Current Status: v0.1.1 - Foundation Complete (September 2025)

**Status:** [X] **COMPLETED** - Core implementation and documentation finished  
**Achievement:** Full post-quantum algorithm implementation with comprehensive security documentation

### [X] Completed Foundation Work
- [x] Complete unsafe code documentation and justification
- [x] Architecture documentation with FFI boundary analysis  
- [x] Security vulnerability reporting policy
- [x] Comprehensive security testing suite
- [x] Cross-platform implementation (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- [x] Supply chain integrity verification system
- [x] Memory safety validation and documentation

## Current Priorities: Q4 2025

**Focus:** Community Audit and Funding Phase

### Community Audit Initiative
- [ ] Open source community security review
- [ ] Academic cryptography community feedback
- [ ] Independent security researcher analysis
- [ ] Community-driven testing and validation

### Grant Funding and Support  
- [ ] Research foundation grant applications
- [ ] Open source security initiative funding
- [ ] Academic institution partnership opportunities
- [ ] Government cybersecurity grant programs

## 2026 Goals: Production Release

Following successful security audit and validation:

- [ ] Long-term API stability commitment
- [ ] Enterprise deployment support
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation for production use

## Algorithm Implementation Status

### [X] Complete Implementations
- [x] ML-KEM (Kyber) - 512, 768, 1024 bit security levels
- [x] ML-DSA (Dilithium) - Levels 2, 3, 5
- [x] Falcon - 512, 1024 bit variants
- [x] SPHINCS+ - Multiple parameter configurations
- [x] Hybrid cryptography support (Classical + PQ combinations)
