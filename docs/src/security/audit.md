# Audit Readiness

Cypheron Core (v0.1.1) has been prepared for professional security audits with comprehensive documentation and transparency measures.

## Current Status

**Status:** [X] **AUDIT READY** - Complete documentation and security analysis finished  
**Phase:** Seeking community audit and professional security evaluation  
**Timeline:** Q4 2025 community audit, 2026 professional audit

## Audit Documentation Package

### 1. Security Architecture
- [**Security Architecture**](../architecture/security.md) - Complete security model
- [**FFI Boundary Analysis**](../architecture/ffi.md) - Trust boundaries and memory safety
- [**Memory Safety Model**](../architecture/memory.md) - Safety guarantees and validation

### 2. Code Transparency  
- [**Unsafe Code Guide**](../../UNSAFE_GUIDE.md) - All 91 unsafe blocks documented
- [**Build System Security**](../development/build.md) - Secure compilation process
- [**Vendor Code Integrity**](../architecture/security.md#vendor-code-provenance) - Supply chain security

### 3. Security Policies
- [**Security Policy**](../../SECURITY.md) - Vulnerability reporting and response
- [**Development Roadmap**](../../ROADMAP.md) - Current priorities and timeline

## Audit Scope

### In Scope
- FFI boundary security between Rust and C code
- Memory safety of wrapper implementations  
- Build system security and vendor code integrity
- API design and usage patterns
- Error handling and secure cleanup
- Platform-specific security implementations

### Out of Scope  
- NIST C reference implementation algorithms (externally audited)
- Standard Rust compiler safety guarantees
- Operating system security features
- Network protocol implementations (none present)

```

### Key Audit Entry Points
1. [**Security Model**](model.md) - Start here for overall security approach
2. [**FFI Boundary**](../architecture/ffi.md) - Primary attack surface analysis
3. [**Unsafe Code Guide**](unsafe-guide.md) - All potentially vulnerable code sections

## Community Audit Process

### Current Phase: Community Validation
- Open source security community review
- Academic cryptography community feedback  
- Independent security researcher analysis
- Public vulnerability disclosure process

### How to Participate
- Review [Security Policy](reporting.md) for vulnerability reporting
- Examine [Unsafe Code Guide](../../UNSAFE_GUIDE.md) for code analysis
- Test security properties using provided test suite
- Report findings through responsible disclosure process

## Professional Audit Preparation

Following successful community validation:
- [ ] Engage qualified cryptographic auditing firm
- [ ] Execute formal security audit of all components  
- [ ] Address any findings from security audit
- [ ] Obtain public security audit report
- [ ] Prepare for production release

## Standards Compliance

Prepared for evaluation against:
- NIST post-quantum cryptography standards (FIPS 203, 204, 205)
- Memory safety best practices for Rust FFI
- Supply chain security standards
- Open source security audit methodologies
